Density Estimators
==================

Real-space on a rectangular grid
--------------------------------

The simplest way to collect the density is to create a rectangular array of
bins and histogram the beads of the paths. For example, a grid defined by

*   ``xmin, xmax, nx``

*   ``ymin, ymax, ny``

*   ``zmin, zmax, nz``

has ``nx*ny*nz`` rectangular bins, each with dimension ``dx = (xmax-xmin)/nx``
by ``dy = (ymax-ymin)/nz`` by ``dz = (zmax-zmin)/nz``. The bin with indicies
``(i, j, k)`` is centered at ``( xmin+(i+0.5)*dx, ymin+(j+0.5)*dy,
zmin+(k+0.5)*dz )``.

Each time a measurement is made, the position of all ``npart*nslice`` beads is
checked, where ``npart`` is the number of particles of the species whose
density is being measured. If a bead is inside one of the bins, that bin is
increased by ``1./nslice``. If all beads lie in the grid bins, then the bins
sum to ``npart``. Otherwise the total is less than ``npart``; this can happen
if the grid dimensions do not fill the simulation supercell. To convert the
measurement to density, divide by the volume of a bin, ``dx * dy * dz``.

      <Cartesian dir="y" nbin="500" min="-255 nm" max="250 nm"/>
    </DensityEstimator>


Real-space on arbitrary grids
-----------------------------

Density in k-space
------------------

Since pi-qmc uses a position basis, we often collect density fluctuations in real
space. However, most textbook descriptions of density fluctioans are in
k-space, and results for homogeneous systems are often best represented in
k-space. Here we give a brief summary of common definitions for pedagogical
purposes. For simplicity we write all formulas for spinless particles.

The dimensionsless Fourier transform of the density operator is (Eqs. 1.11 and
1.66 of Giuliani and Vignale)

.. math::
   :label:

   n_{\mathbf{k}} &= \sum_j e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}_j} \\
   &= \sum_{\mathbf{q}} a^\dagger_\mathbf{q-k} a_{\mathbf{q}}.

Note that :math:`n_{\boldsymbol{0}} = N`, the total number of particles.

The pi code does not presently calculate this expectation value. If it is
implemented in the future, it should return a complex expectation value for
each k-vector. The imaginary part of this estimator will be zero for systems
with inversion symmetry about the origin.

Homegeneous systems, such as liquid helium or the electron gas, will have
:math:`\langle n_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle = 0`
for all :math:`\mathbf{k} \ne 0`.
In those cases, it is better to calculate the 
static structure factor 
(see :ref:`static structure factor<static-structure-factor>`).
