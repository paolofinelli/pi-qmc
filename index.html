        <p>This is a quantum simulation program from the 
        <a href="http://shumway.physics.asu.edu">Shumway Research Group</a>, 
        which focuses on applications to nanoscience and technology. 
        Path integral Quantum Monte Carlo (PI-QMC) simulates particles (often electrons and ions) by 
        directly sampling the canonical partition function. In the path integral formulation of 
        quantum statistical mechanics developed by Richard Feynman, particles get represented by 
        closed imaginary-time trajectories of length ‚Ñè/kT. PI-QMC simulations are able to compute 
        total energies, correlation functions, charge distribution, and linear response functions 
        for thermal equilibrium. As in many quantum Monte Carlo methods, PI-QMC has efficient scaling 
        with system size, often order N<sup>2</sup> or N<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Our application, pi-qmc, is well-suited for modeling conduction electrons 
and holes in quantum dots, quantum wires, and quantum wells. 
For quantum dots and wires, we often generate realistic confining potentials using qdot-tools. 
We are also testing and developing pi-qmc for ab initio calculations, but at this point only hydrogen 
and helium systems work well.</p>

<p>To get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>To download the code, just 
<a href="https://github.com/phys-tools/pi-qmc/zipball/master">download 
the zip file</a> or use 
<a href="https://github.com/phys-tools/pi-qmc">use git</a>. </li>
<li>This is an active research code, and currently all versions are 
development (beta).  We highly recommend 
<a href="https://github.com/phys-tools/pi-qmc">using git</a>
for easy updates.</li>
<li>Read the manual: <a href="http://pi-qmc.readthedocs.org">pi-qmc documentation</a>.</li>
<li>To test out pi-qmc without downloading or installing anything, try the 
(sadly out of date)
<a href="https://nanohub.org/tools/pimc/"/>online nanoHUB tool</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send me your feedback:
<a href="mailto:john.shumway@asu.edu">john.shumway@asu.edu</a>. 
This is my group's primary research code. 
Most of my efforts go towards our group research needs and collaborative 
science projects, 
but I'm making this code public to help everyone. 
Path integrals are fun, and I think a lot of interesting research can be 
enabled with some cooperation. 
I like to hear from other scientists, either via email or on the issues page. 
Instructional or tutorial material is much easier to justify if people 
document their interests. 
New developers are welcome to join this project.</p>
