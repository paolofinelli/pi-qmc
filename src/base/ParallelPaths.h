/// Storage for paths in a parallel simulation.
/// This is parallelization in imaginary time.
/// The parallelization strategy is like parallelzing a lattice model in 1D.
/// The simplest idea is to break time up into nworker domains, each 
/// each approximately equal in size.
/// The size of the domain stored on the worker is nProcSlice.
/// For example, if we have 1024 slices and four workers, 
/// nslice=256.
/// The boundaries between slices should be frozen. 
/// We accomplish this by freezing slice i=0 and slice i=nProcSlice.
/// Note that slice i=0 is slice i=nprocSlice on the previous worker,
/// and slice i=nprocSlice is slice i=0 on the next worker.
/// For single-slice or multi-level sampling, each worker 
/// should only move beads on slices i=1 through i=nprocSlice-1. 
/// However, for measurements and displace moves, it is important that
/// all slices, including the buffers, be owned by exactly one worker.
/// That is other workers may have copies of buffer slice data, but only
/// the owner (owning worker) should evalauate estimators or perform
/// displacement movements on the beads.
/// We adopt the convention that each worker owns i=nprocSlice.
/// To compute estimators or make displace moves, it is necessary that
/// each worker also have a read-only copy of slice i=nprocSlice+1.
///
/// To summarize, each worker has nproc+2 slices stored on it.
/// Slice i=0 is read only and is owned by the previous worker.
/// Slice i=nprocSlice is owned by the worker, but is only moved in
/// displace moves.
/// Slice i=nprocSlice+1 is read only and is owned by the next worker.
/// 
/// To communicate these ideas with the rest of the code, which may
/// deal with serial paths, parallel paths, or double parallel paths,
/// we have three informative methods: getLowestOwnedSlice,
/// getHighestOwnedSlice, and getHighestSampledSlice.
/// These should return 1, nprocSlice, and nprocSlice-nsampling.
/// 
/// Finally, we have shiftWorkers and setBuffers method to communicate
/// slices between workers.
