/** Class for evaluating long range Coulomb interaction at one dimension.
For a nano-wire with a screening layer, the long range Coulomb interaction 
is a well-behaved smooth function that can be approximated by a polynomial 
containing only even order terms, which enable us to significantly improve the 
speed of the calculation.
